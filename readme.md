# Silence by Design  
## Constitutional Censorship and Data Governance in Health Online Communities

This repository accompanies the research paper:

**“Silence by Design: Constitutional Censorship and Data Governance in Health Online Communities”**

It provides the theoretical framework, methodological structure, and analytical logic used to examine how platform rules function as constitutional documents that engineer silence and shape health literacy in digital communities.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Digital health communities are critical spaces for information exchange, support, and collective knowledge production. Yet, the **rules governing these spaces** are rarely examined as instruments of power.

This project analyzes **health-related subreddit rules** as **constitutional texts** that:
- Regulate what can be said
- Define who can speak
- Determine which forms of health knowledge are legitimate
- Create structural barriers to health literacy

Importantly, this study focuses **exclusively on platform rules**, not user-generated content or moderation outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- Conceptualize platform rules as **constitutional governance documents**
- Reframe censorship as a form of **data governance**
- Identify how silence is **engineered structurally**, not incidentally
- Analyze the implications of rule-based governance for **health literacy and epistemic justice**

---

## 🧩 Analytical Framework

The study is built around a **four-dimensional rule analysis framework**:

1. **Silencing Techniques**  
   How rules restrict speech, participation, and knowledge circulation

2. **Justification Frameworks**  
   How censorship is legitimized (science, safety, morality, legality)

3. **Enforcement Architecture**  
   How rules are operationalized (automation, discretion, sanctions)

4. **Epistemic Impact**  
   What knowledge, voices, and questions are structurally excluded

## 🏛 Governance Models Identified

From the rule analysis, four governance models emerge:

- **Clinical Gatekeeper**
- **Supportive Community**
- **Inclusive Forum**
- **Structured Hybrid**

Each model produces distinct patterns of silence and creates different levels of health literacy accessibility.

## 📐 Methodological Scope

- **Data source:** Subreddit rules only  
- **Sample:** 25 health-related subreddits  
- **Method:** Qualitative constitutional document analysis  
- **Excluded:**  
  - User posts or comments  
  - Moderation actions  
  - Engagement metrics  

This ensures a **pure analysis of governance design**, not its implementation.

---

## 🧠 Key Contributions

- Introduces a **constitutional approach** to platform governance analysis
- Advances **silence studies** in digital environments
- Reconceptualizes censorship as **rule-based data governance**
- Provides tools for analyzing **health literacy as structurally mediated**

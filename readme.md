# Constitutional Censorship in Health Subreddits

This repository accompanies the research project **“Constitutional Censorship in Digital Health Communities: A Four-Dimensional Analysis of Silence Production in Health Subreddit Governance.”**

The project examines how health-related subreddits construct and legitimize silence through formal community rules that function as constitutional governance documents. Rather than analyzing moderation outcomes or user content, the study focuses exclusively on rule texts as pre-emptive architectures of discourse control.

## Research Focus

The analysis conceptualizes subreddit rules as instruments of **constitutional censorship**, operating across four analytical dimensions:

- **Silencing Techniques** – How rules restrict speech through prohibitions, source controls, and participation barriers  
- **Justification Frameworks** – Why censorship is legitimized through scientific, safety, ethical, or community-based rationales  
- **Enforcement Architecture** – How governance is operationalized through automation, discretion, and sanctioning systems  
- **Epistemic Impact** – What forms of knowledge, voices, and questions are rendered invisible or illegitimate

## Scope and Methodology

- Document-based qualitative analysis of health subreddit rule sets  
- No analysis of user-generated content or moderation practices  
- Focus on constitutional design rather than implementation  
- Comparative and typological approach across multiple health communities

## Theoretical Contributions

This project contributes to:
- Platform governance theory
- Digital constitutionalism
- Silence studies
- Epistemic injustice and health communication research

By treating community rules as foundational governance texts, the study highlights how epistemic boundaries are designed, justified, and enforced in digital health spaces.
